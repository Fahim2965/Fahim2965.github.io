    <p class="p2">Project #1. This is one of many projects that I have worked on while I was learning Security. <br> This diagram in particular is an example of security floor plan for an Urgent Care</p>

    <p class="p2">Project #2. 
        <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQG0KwkB3anLLwr51B5UCuR777xeYS4yE06AvLAOiYtbBz5h2yuDXvE9FcUHsxkgrifsi7npm5ASTQn/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="560" height="560" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
    <p class="p2">Project #3. For this project my classmate and I hade to build our own PC from scratch. This was really fun because it was very hands on and Building a PC from scratch can give you a sense of accomplishment and pride. You're creating something that works and that you can use for a long time. <br>
        Building a PC can be a great learning experience. I learned about the different parts that make up a computer, how they work together, and how to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.</p>
