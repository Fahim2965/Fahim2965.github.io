    <p class="p2">Project #1. This is one of many projects that I have worked on while I was learning Security. <br> This diagram in particular is an example of security floor plan for an Urgent Care</p>

    <p class="p2">Project #2. For this project my classmate and I hade to build our own PC from scratch. This was really fun because it was very hands on and Building a PC from scratch can give you a sense of accomplishment and pride. <br> You're creating something that works and that you can use for a long time. <br>
        Building a PC can be a great learning experience. I learned about the different parts that make up a computer, how they work together, and how to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.</p>
