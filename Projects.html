    <p class="p2">Project #1. This is one of many projects that I have worked on while I was learning Security. <br> This diagram in particular is an example of security floor plan for an Urgent Care</p>
    <img class="ok" src="Copy of Urgent Care Floor Plan.png" width="350" alt="Picture of a Urgent Care Floor Pnal for security measures">
    <p class="p2">Project #2. For this project my classmate and I hade to build our own PC from scratch. This was really fun because it was very hands on and Building a PC from scratch can give you a sense of accomplishment and pride. You're creating something that works and that you can use for a long time. <br>
        Building a PC can be a great learning experience. I learned about the different parts that make up a computer, how they work together, and how to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.</p>

    <p class="p2">Project #3. This was my first personal website that I have ever created. <br>
         A personal website was a great way to showcase my skills and creativity, as I got to customize the design and content to reflect your personal style and interests.
         Creating a personal website was a great opportunity to learn new skills, such as HTML, CSS, and web design principles, which can be useful in many other contexts.</p>
