    <p class="pg"> Hi, my name is Fahim, and I am a Full Stack student.<br>
    I am starting my adventure into the tech world and hope to achieve many great things.<br>
    I am currently a student at The Brooklyn STEAM Center, and George Westinghouse High School. <br>
    I am currently 15 years old, and I am the youngest of three. I was born in Noakhali, Bangladesh, and lived there for 9 years. I moved to Brooklyn in 2015. <br>
        Some of my interests are playing soccer in my free time. My favorite soccer teams are FC Barcelona, PSG, Liverpool, and Manchester City. <br> 
        My favorite players are Lionel Messi, Christnio Ronaldo, Levendoski, Naymer Jr, and Dybala. I also like playing video games such as Call of Duty and League of Legends, even though I am not that good at them I still like to think of myself as the best player. Another interest of mine is watching anime. I love anime, especially action anime.
    </p>
